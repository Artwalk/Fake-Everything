QSearch(A fake Everything)
=======
I written it two years ago for that I was astonished by Everything's search speed.

------
If you don't know what is Everything, just look at [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_(software)

>Everything is a proprietary freeware Windows desktop search engine that can **rapidly** find files and folders by name on an NTFS volume.


Considering my lack of experience on MFC and C++(I'm sorry about that), if you want to know how to get all files on your NTFS Volume and hash them, just read the **/QSearch/Volume.h**

Oh, The text was still *Chinese*  ^_^

##useage
1. 'Save img as' -> *.jpg
2. .jpg -> .7z
3. unzip *.7z -> (QSearch.exe config.ini)

I want rework it someday.
